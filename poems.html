      <h1>a poem</h1> 
      <p class="poem"> everything i know has come to an end
        when will i begin again<br>
        another life<br>
        another chosen fallen<br>
        another baby bird<br>
        another swallow<br>
        and mother tells me this is it<br>
        may as well enjoy it<br>
        and mother shows me this is all<br>
        i am everything<br>
        and everything is one<br>
        and everything is all<br>
        but i'm still twisting in my darkness<br>
        still turning in my grave<br>
        still remembering lost sorrows<br>
        and forgiving all i gave<br>
        i've seen mountains never breathed upon<br>
        a beauty unsurpassed<br>
        but i never felt the chill of nightfall<br>
        internal beauty always lasts<br>
        so i sit in the familiar<br>
        we play these twisted games<br>
        we laugh when it starts snowing<br>
        after days and days of rain<br>
        the leaves of autumn cover me<br>
        slowly rot and turn to cold<br>
        the sun in spring recovers me<br>
        and i relearn the things i know<br>
        nothing can take this away<br>
        the way i feel on a sunny day<br>
        no nothing can take this away<br>
        and i don't have to forget<br>
        never forget the things you left<br>
        never forget to rewind<br>
        rewind sometimes...<br> <br>

      <h1>ghouls</h1>
      <p class="poem"> i feel the pull it calls me <br>
        as these walls rise up inside me<br>
        i hear screaming let it free<br>
        i feel it breathing in<br>
        <br>
        i inhale my skin turns pale<br>
        i try to rid these thoughts within<br>
        the blade sits close to the demons throat<br>
        always threatening<br>
        <br>
        need to find an inspiration<br>
        inside i think i'm drowning<br>
        drying up, getting sick<br>
        trying to slow down my dying<br>
        <br>
        need to stop this wasting<br>
        every day no soul no tasting<br>
        push on through, give in to you<br>
        put on a mask to the ghouls i'm facing<br>
        <br>
        i want to climb mountains so high there is no oxygen<br>
        swim so deep i see only darkness<br>
        lose my mind and lose my mind<br>
        get lost in time<br>
        <br>
        where the only color i see is red green blue<br>
        yellow orange and a shade of you<br>
        a minute has passed and i swear i knew<br>
        a secret only shared to few<br><br> <br>
